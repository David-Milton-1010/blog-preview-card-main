## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I often try to wrap a flex container inside of another container. This bloats my css and usually causes issues. During this project I simplified and created my flex container, then worked from there. This approach gave me better control over the container itself, and I believe was the best route to take here.
